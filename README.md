# The Great DevOps Journey
## *On this repository, you can track my activities & progress IT wise*

I‚Äôm currently finishing my DevOps Administrator training, and I wanted to consolidate everything I‚Äôve learned along the way.
This repository is where I document my knowledge, hands-on experiments, and the progress I‚Äôve made in IT and DevOps.

With a SysOps background, I already have experience in networking, Linux and Windows systems, as well as virtualization. My goal now is to expand into full DevOps practices, from automation and CI/CD to monitoring and infrastructure as code.
