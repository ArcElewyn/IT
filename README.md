# The great DevOps Journey
## *On this repository, you can track my activities & progress IT wise*

As an IT tech and an aspiring DevOps administrator, I decided to try and learn everything I could by myself. \
So here I am, documenting my learnings and every step that I take. \

Right now I'm quite operationnal with Ansible, docker and Python wise\
I'm currently working on Terraform, Grafana/Prometheus, and a bit of PostgreSQL.
