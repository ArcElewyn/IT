# The Great DevOps Journey
## *On this repository, you can track my activities & progress IT wise*

As an aspiring DevOps administrator, I decided to try and learn everything I could by myself.  
So here I am, documenting my learnings and every progress that I made.

Since I have a SysOps background, I do have knowledge of networking, systems (whether it is Linux or Windows), as well as virtualization.
